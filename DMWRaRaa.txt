Data Mining with Rattle and R: The Art of Excavating Data for Knowledge Discovery by Graham Williams, 

Appendix A Installing Rattle
Rattle relies on an extensive collection of free and open source software. Some preliminary steps need to be followed in installing it. The latest installation instructions are maintained at http://rattle.togaware.com. The instructions cover Rattle on GNU/Linux, Microsoft Windows and MacOS/X.Rattle is distributed as a freely available open source R package available from CRAN, the Comprehensive R Archive Network (http://cran.r-project.org/). The source code for Rattle is available from Google Code (http://code.google.com/p/rattle/). A discussion mailing list is available from Google Groups (http://groups.google.com/group/rattle-users).If you are setting up a new data mining platform, the recommended approach is to build it on top of the Ubuntu operating system (http://ubuntu.com). This delivers a free and open source environment for data mining.If you already have R installed and have installed the appropriate GTK libraries for your operating system, then installing Rattle is as simple as:> install.packages("rattle")Once installed, the function rattleInfo() provides version information for rattle and dependencies and will also check for available updates and generate the command that can be cut-and-pasted to update the appropriate packages:> rattleInfo()Rattle: version 2.6.7 cran 2.6.6R: version 2.13.0 (2011-04-13) (Revision 55427)Sysname: LinuxRelease: 2.6.35-28-genericVersion: #49-Ubuntu SMP Tue Mar 1 14:39:03 UTC 2011Nodename: nyxMachine: x86_64Login: unknownUser: gjwInstalled DependenciesRGtk2: version 2.20.12pmml: version 1.2.27bitops: version 1.0-4.1colorspace: version 1.1-0ada: version 2.0-2amap: version 0.8-5arules: version 1.0-6biclust: version 1.0.1cairoDevice: version 2.15cba: version 0.2-6descr: version 0.3.4doBy: version 4.3.1 upgrade available 4.4.0e1071: version 1.5-26ellipse: version 0.3-5fEcofin: version 290.76fBasics: version 2110.79foreign: version 0.8-44fpc: version 2.0-3gdata: version 2.8.2gtools: version 2.6.2gplots: version 2.8.0
